* Student's AI Usage and Academic Performance 

This study explores the relationship between students’ use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and academic performance using a synthetic dataset representing demographics, study habits, AI usage patterns, and grades. Exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, regression modeling, and classification were conducted to assess whether AI usage is associated with academic improvement. Results indicate that AI usage is strongly associated with positive grade changes, with large effect sizes observed. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that conclusions are robust across multiple modeling choices. While findings illustrate methodological approaches to studying AI adoption in education, causal claims are limited due to the synthetic nature of the dataset.
